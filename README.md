Hello friendly strangers, I’m Simon.

🔬　I study computer science at [@UMich](https://github.com/umich), and I want to tackle misinformation with NLP.  
🌊　I build [surge.fm](https://github.com/surgefm), a crowd-sourced news tracking platform.  
📖　I’m a K-12 officer at [@tbpmig](https://github.com/tbpmig). I build quirky web-based educational thingies for kids.  
✨　I used to be a high school teacher in rural Hainan and a [@nytimes](https://github.com/nytimes) intern in Beijing.  
🐱　I’m a cat person.  
🐲　I have a pet duck Ducky, as shown in my profile pic.  
🍵　My favorate poem is _“Useless”_ by Weitang Liao:
> 　_即使是这样_  
> 　_我们仍然相信自己活着，_
